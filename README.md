# About
Vulcan (Visual UML Link and Class Analyzing Neural-network) was my final school Project for the german "Wissenschaftsseminar". The associated paper can be found under "./VulcanPaper.pdf" and is written in German.
## Goals
The aim of the project was to take images (jpeg/PNGs) of UML Diagrams as an input and generate structured Code-Outlines for the provided Diagrams in Java.
## Scientific Basis
The Project uses CV2 and OCR to analyze the provided image and generates the Code based on that. The basis for this research was provided by my own studies at the Technical University of Munich and by previous research of  B. Karasneh and M. R. V. Chaudron of the dutch "Leiden University". Special thanks to Karasneh for providing personal help during development.
## Successrates
The model can successfully detect, read and convert high-quality images to the right code approximately 90% of the time.
